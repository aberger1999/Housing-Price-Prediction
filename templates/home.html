        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This is my housing price prediction project by Alex Berger. The goals of this project is to clean and process 
          housing data from Ames, Iowa then formulate a model to predict further new data. The project data analysis 
          and model development were done in Jupyter Notebook which will be shown in snippets below. The model in this application uses a Keras neural network.

          <figcaption>This image shows the subfeatures of the categorical features and the features that were dropped before model prep because they were either
            too confusing for model deployment or they were not of importance. There were 82 features before, that was reduced to 19.

          <figcaption>This picture shows the mean of the numerical features of the data set. Below that shows a function to get outliers from the data set and then
            we can see the values of the each numerical feature at each quantile. At the bottem of the picture it shows the numer of outliers in the data that fall above the
            75th quantile and below the 25th quantile. There are 398 outliers.

          <figcaption>This is a plot of the neighborhoods in the data set and there frequencies. Because location is a very important aspect of predicting home prices
            it is important to see how neighborhood affects the data.

          <figcaption>In this plot we examine housing styles of the data, we can see that '1story' is the most popular by far then '2story' but the other house styles draw
            confussion because I am unsure what they mean in the real-world.

          <figcaption>This plot shows the feature 'Overall Qual'. Most of the values are for 5 and then increases down. There is strong correlation between 
            this feature and sale price
            which is shown later.

          <figcaption>This plot shows the 'Half Bath' feature and what is intresting about this feature is that the majority of the values are in 0 half baths, I was expecting 
            houses to have more half baths.</figcaption>

            seem evenly distributated.

          <figcaption>This image shows the linear regression model that came up with an accuracy of 92.2% which is better than all the rest of the models. Would use this model in
            application deployment because it is simply the best way I think to represent any housing data but I still wanted to build another neural network.
